# Overview

This document is essentially an organizer for the requirements for our application. It lists the various aspects/screens of our app and gives
guidelines as to what each must accomplish in order to be identified as "completed". As our project development and processes continue, the requirements, functionalities, and aspects/screens are likely to expand and change.

# Software Requirements
<Describe the structure of this section>

# Functional Requirements
 
1. Login System/Screen
    * There shall be a sign-up button if the user has never signed up.
    * The user shall create a username to use for future log in.
    * The user shall create a password to use for future log in.
    * The user shall be able to use their personal username and password to log in.
    * If the user enters the password or username wrong, there shall be a prompt displayed to notify the user that they typed their login credintials incorectly.
    * There shall be a forgotten username or password button at the bottom for the user to reset the username or password. (maybe?)

2. Opening Screen/Further screens
    * Once logged in, the options for “smell, sight, feel, sound and if it won’t start” shall be presented upon opening the app/after logging in.
    * Once the user clicks an option, they shall get a list of "smells, sights, feels, etc." to choose from.
    * Once the user chooses an option based on the senses, they shall get a list of answers, recomondation on what to do, and the average cost for repair.

If we do user feedback these can go with whats above
    * The public comments shall be presented to you at the end of diagnoses to give you a solution.
    * Users shall be able to upvote and downvote public comments
    * Software shall allow users to comment to solutions and discuss
     
3. Settings
    * There shall be a settings button on the opening screen/diognosis screen.
    * There shall be a dark mode and light mode enabler in settings.
    * There shall be a "log out" button inside the settings for the user to log out.

# Non-Functional Requirements

1. Usability
    * The app shall always be available for the user to use at any time.
    * The app shall be accommodating to those with disabilities, i.e. The font is easy to read, the layout is clear and simple, etc.
    * The transition screens shall be fast, so the user does not think their device is slow.
    * Buttons shall be appropriately labeled so there is no user confusion.
    * The application shall be simple to use and have a design that does not need instructions/guidelines to use.
 
 Options I think we can use:
 
* Information found should be accurate for user.
* Software shall take less than 5 seconds to open and load.
* Software shall work on every iPhone that supports iOS 16 and up.
* App should not crash due to extended use or system bugs.
* App can handle increased usage and more data as time progresses.
